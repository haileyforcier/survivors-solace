# survivors-solace
The text-based adventure-style game, Survivor's Solace, is my final project for the Programming Fundamentals course I was enrolled in. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My motivation for creating this game was to apply everything I've learned in my first semester of the IT - Software Development program at CVTC. 
I've enjoyed the process of learning new things along the way, especially the moments of realization while debugging. 
My inspiration for the game's style comes from my love for 8-bit games and 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books, and it's been amazing to create something similar.

In Survivor's Solace, you play as a survivor of a zombie apocalypse known as the Fall. The ultimate objective of the game is to find the Sanctuary, a safe haven amidst the chaos.
