# survivors-solace
The text-based adventure-style game, Survivor's Solace, is my final project for the Programming Fundamentals course I was enrolled in. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

While the first chapter is my final project, I do plan on continuing it as a personal one. 
My motivation for creating this game was to apply everything I've learned in my first semester of the IT - Software Development program at CVTC. 
I've enjoyed the process of learning new things along the way, especially the moments of realization while debugging. 
My inspiration for the game's style comes from my love for 8-bit games and 'Choose your own adventure' books, and it's been amazing to create something similar.

In Survivor's Solace, you play as a survivor of a zombie apocalypse known as the Fall. The ultimate objective of the game is to find the Sanctuary, a safe haven amidst the chaos. 
At the moment, I've only managed to complete the first chapter of the game. In the future, I'm planning to introduce more visual elements, including a map that I'm currently working on. 
I also have plans to incorporate character images, scenery images, and the option to customize your character. 
I aim to expand the game by adding at least five more locations, with the first chapter featuring only one of them.
